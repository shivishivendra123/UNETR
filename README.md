# UNETR Implementation

## Overview
This repository contains an implementation of UNETR (UNet Transformer) for medical image segmentation. UNETR leverages a transformer-based encoder to model long-range dependencies and a CNN-based decoder for precise segmentation.

## Features
- Transformer-based encoder for better contextual understanding.
- CNN decoder for accurate segmentation.
- Supports 3D medical image segmentation.
- Optimized for PyTorch.

## Installation
To run this project, install the required dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/UNETR.git
   cd UNETR
   ```
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook UNETR.ipynb
   ```
3. Modify configurations as needed in the notebook.

## Dataset
- Ensure the dataset is structured as expected.
- Update the data paths in the notebook accordingly.

## Results
- Model performance metrics and segmentation results are available in the notebook.
- Visualizations of segmented outputs are provided.

## Contributing
Feel free to submit pull requests or open issues for improvements and bug fixes.
